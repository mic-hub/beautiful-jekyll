[Bibliography in BIB-format](/assets/modeling.bib)

# Edit: 

New version -> I had to modified the cite-keys, because Pandoc doesn't like ";" in an key (e.g. Craig;Nersessian;etal:2002aa)

> The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or _, and may contain alphanumerics, _, and internal punctuation characters (:.#$%&-+?<>~/).
